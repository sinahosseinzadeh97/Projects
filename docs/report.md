## Introduction

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning system that can predict loan status based on historical lending data. The system aims to help financial institutions assess the risk of loan default by analyzing various factors related to loan characteristics and borrower information.

### Project Objectives

1. Process and analyze historical lending data
2. Develop machine learning models to predict loan status
3. Evaluate and optimize model performance
4. Deploy the best-performing model as a web application

## Data Acquisition and Exploration

### Dataset

The project utilized a lending dataset containing 10,000 loan records with 55 variables. The dataset includes information about loan characteristics (amount, interest rate, term), borrower information (income, employment length, credit history), and loan outcomes (status, payments).

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Initial data exploration revealed several key insights:

1. **Loan Status Distribution**: The dataset contains a balanced distribution of loans in good standing and default status.

2. **Loan Amount Distribution**: The loan amounts range from $1,000 to $35,000, with a median of approximately $12,000.

3. **Interest Rate Distribution**: Interest rates range from 5% to 25%, with higher rates generally associated with higher default risk.

4. **Loan Status by Grade**: Lower grade loans (D-G) show higher default rates compared to higher grade loans (A-C).

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Several features show strong correlation with loan status, including payment history, interest rate, and loan grade.

## Data Preprocessing

The raw data required extensive preprocessing before model development:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were imputed using appropriate strategies (median for numerical features, mode for categorical features).

2. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to capture payment behavior, debt-to-income ratios, and credit utilization.

3. **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding and label encoding as appropriate.

4. **Feature Selection**: Reduced dimensionality from 4,885 features (after encoding) to 100 most important features using SelectKBest with chi-squared test.

5. **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets with stratification to maintain class balance.

6. **Class Imbalance**: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address any class imbalance in the training data.

## Model Development

Multiple machine learning models were developed and compared:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model with L2 regularization.

2. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.

3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees with bagging.

4. **Neural Network**: A multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers.

Initial model development faced memory constraints due to the high dimensionality of the data. This was addressed by:

1. Implementing feature selection to reduce dimensionality
2. Simplifying the hyperparameter search space
3. Using more memory-efficient algorithms

## Model Evaluation and Optimization

### Performance Metrics

Models were evaluated using multiple metrics:

1. **AUROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
2. **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions.
3. **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives.
4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### Model Comparison

The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with near-perfect accuracy:

### Feature Importance

Analysis of feature importance revealed the most predictive factors for loan status:

1. **Paid Principal**: Amount of principal paid so far
2. **Paid Total**: Total amount paid so far
3. **Interest Rate**: The interest rate on the loan
4. **Issue Month/Year**: When the loan was issued
5. **State**: Borrower's state of residence

### Model Optimization

The Random Forest model was further optimized through:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search for optimal parameters (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split).
2. **Threshold Optimization**: Finding the optimal probability threshold for classification (0.5152).
3. **Class Weight Adjustment**: Using balanced class weights to improve performance on minority class.

The optimized model achieved:
- AUROC: 0.9999
- Precision: 1.00
- Recall: 1.00
- F1 Score: 1.00

## Web Application Development
