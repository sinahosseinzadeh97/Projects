# OpenAI API Research

## Overview
For our YouTube Q&A system, we'll use the OpenAI API to generate answers based on relevant transcript segments. The OpenAI API provides access to powerful language models that can understand context and generate human-like responses.

## Key Resources

1. [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference?lang=python)
2. [OpenAI Python Library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
3. [OpenAI Developer Quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)

## Required Python Libraries

```python
import openai
from openai import OpenAI
```

## Authentication

```python
# Method 1: Set API key in code (not recommended for production)
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")

# Method 2: Set API key as environment variable (recommended)
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
client = OpenAI()  # Automatically uses OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
```

## Key Functionality

1. **Chat Completions API**:
   - Primary API for generating responses based on context
   - Supports various models (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo)
   - Can be used with system messages to control response behavior

2. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Structure prompts to get consistent, high-quality responses
   - Include system message to define the assistant's role and constraints

## Example Code for Answer Generation

```python
def generate_answer(question, context, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    """
    Generate an answer to a question based on provided context.
    
    Args:
        question (str): The user's question
        context (str): Relevant transcript segments
        model (str): OpenAI model to use
        
    Returns:
        str: Generated answer
    """
    try:
        client = OpenAI()
        
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based ONLY on the provided context. If the answer cannot be found in the context, say 'I don't have enough information to answer this question.'"},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}"}
            ],
            temperature=0.3,  # Lower temperature for more focused answers
            max_tokens=500    # Limit response length
        )
        
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating answer: {e}")
        return "Sorry, I encountered an error while generating your answer."
```

## Cost Considerations

1. **Pricing Structure**:
   - OpenAI charges based on tokens (roughly 4 characters per token)
   - Different models have different pricing tiers
   - Both input and output tokens are counted for billing

2. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Use the most appropriate model for the task (gpt-3.5-turbo is more cost-effective than gpt-4)
   - Limit context size by selecting only the most relevant transcript segments
   - Implement caching for common questions

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Rate Limits**: OpenAI imposes rate limits on API requests
2. **Token Limits**: Models have maximum context lengths (e.g., 4096 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo)
3. **Latency**: Response generation takes time, especially for longer contexts
4. **Hallucinations**: Models may generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information

## Next Steps

1. Set up secure API key management
2. Implement answer generation function with proper error handling
3. Optimize prompt structure for accurate answers
4. Implement caching to reduce API calls and costs
