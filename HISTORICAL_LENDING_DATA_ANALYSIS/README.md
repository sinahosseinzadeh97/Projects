# Loan Prediction System

A machine learning-based application for predicting loan performance based on borrower characteristics and loan data.

## Overview

The Loan Prediction System is an advanced analytics platform designed to assess borrower risk and predict loan performance. It uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and financial analysis to provide accurate predictions on whether a loan is likely to be in good standing or present a default risk.

## Features

- **Loan Performance Prediction**: Machine learning models that predict loan outcomes based on borrower characteristics
- **Geographic Analysis**: Analysis of loan performance across different geographic regions and economic conditions
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Analysis of seasonal trends and long-term patterns in loan performance
- **Risk Segmentation**: Categorization of borrowers into risk tiers for targeted lending strategies
- **Financial Planning**: Personalized financial planning tools for borrowers based on their profile
- **Competitive Analysis**: Comparison of loan terms and performance with competitive offerings

## Algorithm Explanation

The system currently employs a rule-based scoring model as a baseline, with plans to integrate machine learning models in future updates.

### Current Algorithm Implementation

The current algorithm calculates a risk score using a weighted combination of several key factors:

```python
# Risk factors that contribute to the final prediction
risk_factors = []

# Income factor (higher income = lower risk)
income_factor = min(data['annual_income'] / 100000, 1.0) * 0.25
risk_factors.append(income_factor)

# Debt-to-income factor (lower ratio = lower risk)
dti_factor = (1 - min(data['debt_to_income'] / 50, 1.0)) * 0.2
risk_factors.append(dti_factor)

# Grade factor (A=best, G=worst)
grade_mapping = {'A': 0.2, 'B': 0.15, 'C': 0.1, 'D': 0.05, 'E': 0.0, 'F': -0.05, 'G': -0.1}
grade_factor = grade_mapping.get(data['grade'], 0)
risk_factors.append(grade_factor)

# Employment length factor
emp_factor = min(data['emp_length'] / 10, 1.0) * 0.15
risk_factors.append(emp_factor)

# Calculate final probability (higher = better)
probability = sum(risk_factors) + 0.5  # Baseline of 0.5

# Classification
prediction = 'Good Standing' if probability >= 0.5 else 'Default Risk'
```

### Planned Machine Learning Algorithms

In future updates, the system will implement these advanced machine learning algorithms:

1. **Random Forest**
   - Creates multiple decision trees and combines their outputs
   - Handles non-linear relationships between features
   - Provides feature importance for interpretability
   - Less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees

2. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**
   - Builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting errors from previous trees
   - Generally achieves higher performance for structured data
   - Efficiently handles imbalanced datasets (common in loan default prediction)
   - Features built-in regularization techniques

3. **Logistic Regression**
   - Serves as a baseline model for comparison
   - Highly interpretable coefficients
   - Works well when relationships are mostly linear
   - Efficiently provides probability scores

### Machine Learning Pipeline

The planned ML pipeline includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature scaling (standardization/normalization)
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection based on importance

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Training on historical loan data with known outcomes
   - Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
   - Evaluation using metrics like:
     - ROC-AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve)
     - Precision (proportion of positive identifications that were correct)
     - Recall (proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly)
     - F1 Score (harmonic mean of precision and recall)

3. **Threshold Optimization**
   - Adjusting classification threshold based on business requirements
   - Balancing false positives (approving bad loans) vs. false negatives (rejecting good loans)
   - Different thresholds for different borrower segments

## Model Performance Factors

The prediction accuracy depends on several key factors:

1. **Income and Debt**: Higher income and lower debt-to-income ratio correlate with lower default risk
2. **Credit History**: Represented by the loan grade, with grades A-G reflecting decreasing creditworthiness
3. **Employment Stability**: Longer employment history correlates with lower default risk
4. **Loan Terms**: Interest rate and loan duration impact repayment probability
5. **Verification Status**: Verified income provides higher confidence in the prediction
