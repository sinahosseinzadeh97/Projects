# Intelligent Multi-Agent Email Automation System

## Overview

The Intelligent Multi-Agent Email Automation System is a comprehensive platform that automates email management through multiple specialized agents. The system automatically processes incoming emails by reading, classifying, summarizing, and generating responses with minimal human intervention, while also integrating with external services such as calendars and CRMs to streamline productivity.

## Key Features

- **Automated Email Processing**: Automatically retrieve, classify, summarize, and respond to emails
- **Intelligent Classification**: Categorize emails into predefined classes (important, promotional, support, etc.)
- **Smart Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of email content
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Create intelligent reply drafts based on email content and classification
- **External Integrations**: Connect with calendar systems, CRMs, and task managers
- **Management Dashboard**: Monitor system performance and manage email processing
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure system behavior to match specific needs

## System Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with specialized agents that work together to process emails:

1. **Email Ingestion Agent**: Connects to email providers and retrieves emails
2. **Classification Agent**: Categorizes emails into predefined classes
3. **Summarization & Extraction Agent**: Generates summaries and extracts key data
4. **Response Generation Agent**: Creates context-aware reply drafts
5. **Integration & Orchestration Agent**: Coordinates between agents and external services
