## System Components

### Email Ingestion Agent
Connects to email providers, retrieves emails, and prepares them for processing.

### Classification Agent
Analyzes email content and categorizes emails into predefined classes.

### Summarization & Extraction Agent
Generates concise summaries of email content and extracts key data points.

### Response Generation Agent
Creates intelligent and context-aware reply drafts.

### Integration & Orchestration Agent
Coordinates between agents and manages external integrations.

### Management Dashboard
Provides a user interface for monitoring and control.

## Data Flow

1. The Email Ingestion Agent retrieves emails from providers
2. Emails are passed to the Classification Agent for categorization
3. Classified emails are sent to the Summarization & Extraction Agent
4. Processed emails are sent to the Response Generation Agent
5. The Integration & Orchestration Agent coordinates the workflow and external integrations
6. The Management Dashboard provides visibility and control over the entire process

## External Integrations

- Email Providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Calendar Systems (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.)
- CRM Systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Task Management Systems (Asana, Trello, etc.)

## Technical Stack
