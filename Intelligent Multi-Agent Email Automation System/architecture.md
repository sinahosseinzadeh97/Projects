# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of the Intelligent Multi-Agent Email Automation System, a comprehensive platform that automates email management through multiple specialized agents. The system automatically processes incoming emails by reading, classifying, summarizing, and generating responses with minimal human intervention, while also integrating with external services such as calendars and CRMs to streamline productivity.

## System Components
The system consists of six main components that work together to provide a complete email automation solution:

### 1. Email Ingestion Agent
- **Purpose**: Connect to email providers, retrieve and parse emails
- **Key Functions**:
  - Connect to email providers using IMAP/SMTP protocols and APIs
  - Retrieve emails from multiple accounts and providers
  - Parse email content and metadata
  - Forward processed emails to subsequent agents
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Uses Python's email and imaplib libraries for email retrieval
  - Supports asynchronous operations for handling high email volumes
  - Provides robust error handling for connection issues

### 2. Classification Agent
- **Purpose**: Categorize incoming emails into predefined classes
- **Key Functions**:
  - Analyze email content and metadata
  - Classify emails into categories (important, promotional, support, spam, etc.)
  - Assign priority levels to emails
  - Filter out irrelevant emails
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Uses NLP models like BERT for classification tasks
  - Optimized for both speed and accuracy
  - Provides confidence scores for classifications

### 3. Summarization & Extraction Agent
- **Purpose**: Generate concise summaries and extract key data points
- **Key Functions**:
  - Create brief summaries of email content
  - Extract important dates, times, and deadlines
  - Identify contact information
  - Recognize action items and tasks
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Uses modern LLMs for summarization
  - Employs entity recognition for data extraction
  - Handles both structured and unstructured email content

### 4. Response Generation Agent
- **Purpose**: Create intelligent and context-aware reply drafts
- **Key Functions**:
  - Generate appropriate responses based on email content and classification
  - Use templates as starting points for responses
  - Provide auto-send recommendations
  - Allow for manual review of generated responses
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Uses advanced NLP models for response generation
  - Maintains professional tone in all responses
  - Adapts responses based on email context and category

### 5. Integration & Orchestration Agent
- **Purpose**: Coordinate between agents and manage external integrations
- **Key Functions**:
  - Orchestrate the workflow between different agents
  - Integrate with calendar systems for scheduling
  - Connect with CRMs for contact management
  - Link with task management systems
  - Handle email sending operations
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Uses a microservices approach for modularity
  - Manages API connections to external services
  - Provides a unified interface for all integrations

### 6. Management Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Provide a user interface for monitoring and control
- **Key Functions**:
  - Display real-time system status and performance metrics
  - Allow manual override of automated decisions
  - Provide detailed logging and analytics
  - Configure system settings and preferences
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Built with modern web frameworks
  - Features responsive design for all devices
  - Provides secure access controls

## Data Flow
The system follows a sequential processing flow:

1. The Email Ingestion Agent retrieves emails from configured providers
2. Retrieved emails are passed to the Classification Agent for categorization
3. Classified emails are processed by the Summarization & Extraction Agent
4. Processed emails are sent to the Response Generation Agent for reply creation
5. The Integration & Orchestration Agent manages the overall workflow and external integrations
6. The Management Dashboard provides visibility and control over the entire process

## External Integrations
The system integrates with several external services:

- **Email Providers**: Gmail, Outlook, and other IMAP/SMTP providers
- **Calendar Systems**: For scheduling meetings and appointments
- **CRM Systems**: For managing contact information
- **Task Management Systems**: For creating and tracking tasks

## Technical Stack
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **NLP & LLM Technologies**: BERT, GPT or similar models
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing email and metadata
- **Caching**: Redis for session data and improved responsiveness
- **Frontend**: Modern web frameworks (specific framework to be determined)

## Security Considerations
- Secure API communications with proper authentication
- Encrypted storage of sensitive information
- Role-based access controls for the dashboard
- Compliance with email privacy regulations

## Scalability
- Asynchronous processing for handling high volumes
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling of components
- Optimized database queries and caching for performance
