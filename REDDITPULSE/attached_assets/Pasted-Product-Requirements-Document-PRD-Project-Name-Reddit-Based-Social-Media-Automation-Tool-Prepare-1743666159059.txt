Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Name: Reddit-Based Social Media Automation Tool
Prepared For: AI Coding Assistant / Developer
Date: April 2, 2025
1. Overview

We are building a Python-based automation system to monitor Reddit discussions in targeted niches (health, wellness, alternative medicine) and automatically engage with contextually appropriate responses. The tool should work autonomously with a natural human tone and include performance monitoring.
2. Objectives

    Monitor Reddit for relevant discussions.

    Identify posts matching target keywords/topics.

    Generate and post helpful, non-spammy responses.

    Respect Reddit's API rate limits and rules.

    Log all actions and results for transparency.

3. Core Features
a. Monitoring Engine

    Use Reddit API (via PRAW) to monitor selected subreddits.

    Support configurable keyword matching and topic detection.

    Filter out irrelevant or low-quality posts.

b. Content Analysis

    Analyze post content for context and relevance to our products.

    Optional NLP-based ranking for post relevance.

c. Automated Response Generator

    Generate responses that:

        Are helpful, informative, and human-like.

        Match Reddit tone and subreddit etiquette.

        Vary in structure to avoid detection as bot.

    Use templated or AI-generated content, with human-approved tone guides.

d. Scheduler

    Post comments based on time rules (e.g., delay after post, interval between comments).

    Avoid spamming or triggering Reddit bot detection.

e. Logging & Tracking

    Log every action: post found, response posted, success/failure.

    Include timestamp, subreddit, post ID, and response ID.

    Optional: measure engagement (upvotes, replies).

4. Technical Requirements
Language & Platform

    Primary: Python 3.8+

    Deployment: Linux-based environment

    Configurable via .env or JSON/YAML config file

Libraries

    Required:

        PRAW (Reddit API wrapper)

        schedule or APScheduler (for timed posting)

        logging (for activity logs)

    Optional:

        TextBlob, spaCy, or transformers for NLP relevance scoring

        dotenv or pydantic for config management

Data Storage

    Log data in flat file (CSV/JSON) or SQLite.

    Configuration should support easy switch to cloud DB if needed.

Deployment & Operations

    Tool must be deployable on any VPS (Ubuntu preferred).

    Provide:

        Setup script or Dockerfile

        Run instructions

        Restart/resume mechanism

5. Non-Functional Requirements

    Reliability: Handles API failures and continues operation.

    Compliance: Obeys Redditâ€™s API rate limits.

    Stealth: Outputs must appear human-written and organic.

    Extensibility: Easily upgradable to include other platforms like X (Twitter), Quora, etc.

6. Deliverables

    Fully working Reddit automation tool

    Source code and configuration files

    Deployment and run guide (README)

    User-friendly setup with clear config inputs

    Sample templates for comment generation

    Logs and performance dashboard (optional)

7. Success Criteria

    The system correctly identifies and replies to posts.

    Comments are not flagged or removed by Reddit mods/bots.

    The posting schedule is followed consistently.

    Logs clearly show the actions taken by the bot.

    Easy to run and configure with minimal manual effort.

8. Optional Enhancements

    Web interface to manage subreddits, templates, and logs.

    Sentiment analysis for comment tone.

    A/B testing to compare different response styles.

    Email or Telegram alerts on new replies or failures.
