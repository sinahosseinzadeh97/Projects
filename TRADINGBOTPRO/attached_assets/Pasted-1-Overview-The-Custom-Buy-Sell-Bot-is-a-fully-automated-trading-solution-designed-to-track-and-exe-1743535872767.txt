1. Overview

The Custom Buy/Sell Bot is a fully automated trading solution designed to track and execute transactions across various wallet transfers. It monitors transfers from a parent wallet through multiple layers (up to a depth of 5) and performs buys/sells automatically based on customizable parameters. The bot supports different transaction types (including normal transactions, Raydium swaps, and WSOL buys) and provides robust error handling, auto-retry logic, and real-time feedback.
2. Objectives

    Fully Automated Trading:
    Implement a bot that automatically tracks transactions and executes buy/sell orders without manual intervention.

    Comprehensive Transaction Tracking:
    Monitor wallet transfers—including multi-step (wallet-to-wallet-to-wallet) transactions—and capture key metrics such as volume, market cap, token age, and purchase details.

    Customizable Trading Logic:
    Allow users to define trading parameters (e.g., minimum/maximum amounts, volume thresholds, token age) and rules (e.g., “if volume is 2.5M, MC is 1M, and token age is 30 minutes, then buy 1 SOL” or “if price increases 30%, then sell”).

    Robust Error Handling and Feedback:
    Provide real-time status updates and notifications when the bot stops or fails, including auto-retry mechanisms for both buy and sell orders.

    Feature Parity with Tradewiz:
    Incorporate all features offered by Tradewiz (and additional custom requirements) to ensure comprehensive transaction support, including anti-MEV options.

    Modern UI:
    Develop a responsive, intuitive user interface using shadcn components to ensure a visually appealing and consistent experience.

    Platform Setup Assistance:
    Provide support and documentation for setting up the bot on Mac and Virtual Machine environments.

3. Target Users

    Crypto Traders and Automated Trading Enthusiasts:
    Individuals and teams seeking an automated trading bot for cryptocurrency transactions.

    Developers & Technical Operators:
    Technical users who require an advanced, customizable tool to monitor and execute trades based on wallet activity.

    Administrators:
    Users who need detailed feedback, logs, and the ability to adjust parameters in real time.

4. Functional Requirements

        Parent wallet address.

        Minimum and maximum transaction amounts.

        Tip, gas fees, and anti-MEV settings.

    UI Elements:

        A configuration dashboard built with shadcn components to ensure a modern, intuitive interface.

4.2 Transaction Tracking

    Multi-Layer Tracking:

        Monitor transfers from wallet to wallet (and wallet-to-wallet-to-wallet) with a tracking depth of at least 5 levels.

    Transaction Types:

        Detect various buy types such as normal buys, Raydium swaps, and WSOL buys.

    Data Extraction:

        Capture key metrics such as volume, market cap (MC), token age, and the time elapsed since purchase.

4.3 Automated Trading Logic

    Buy Logic:

        Execute buy orders based on defined parameters, e.g., “If volume is 2.5M, MC is 1M, and token age is 30 minutes, then buy 1 SOL.”

        Auto-retry buy logic if an order fails.

        Detect large buys and trigger immediate sell orders.

    Sell Logic:

        Execute sell orders when conditions are met, e.g., “If price increases 30%, then sell” or “If more than 10 SOL is bought, autosell.”

        Auto-retry sell operations in case of failures.

4.4 Feedback and Monitoring

    Real-Time Status Updates:

        Display notifications when the bot stops, fails, or completes transactions.

        Provide detailed logs and error reports.

    User Notifications:

        Alert users about important events (e.g., auto-sell triggered, transaction failures).

4.5 Support for Diverse Transaction Scenarios

    Multiple Transaction Flows:

        Handle various scenarios:

            Some coins purchased via Raydium swaps.

            Some coins bought after wallet-to-wallet-to-wallet transfers (using WSOL).

            Others via simple wallet-to-wallet transfers (using SOL).

4.6 Administrative Tools
